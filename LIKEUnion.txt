-- LIKE --

-- 1. How do I use LIKE in a sql SELECT statement.
-- The LIKE command allows "Wild cards". A % may be used to match and string, _ will match any single character.
-- The example shows countries begining with Z. The country Zambia matches because Zambia matches with the %.

SELECT name FROM bbc
WHERE name LIKE 'Z%';

-- 2. Apostrophe --

-- Jump to navigationJump to search
-- How to build a statement on a word with an Apostrophe such as WHERE name='Tom's Book'

SELECT * FROM bbc
WHERE name = 'Cote d''Ivoire';

-- Full text search --

-- 3. Full text search with SQL? such as i want to find a specific word in any colum of the table
-- The "brute force" method is to use use the LIKE operator against any of the fields to be searched. 
-- This will be relatively expensive - but probably good enough in many cases. The term to search for 
-- should be quoted and placed within two wild cards.

-- You should construct the string literal in some scripting language - don't forget to quote it.

-- Column name --

-- 4. How can I display a column name for an aggregate function?
-- Where one of the results returned is calculated (for example with an aggregate) the column name may be assigned arbitrarily.

-- You should be able to specify a column name.

SELECT region, SUM(population) AS x
  FROM bbc
GROUP BY region;

-- 5. Equi Join --

-- I am trying to join two tables with the same name. I am required to use an inner join Also I need to show the managers name. 
-- Question is: Join the employee table with the employee table and department table. Show the employee id, 
-- name, dept code, manager id, manager name, managers department code, and name for that (mgr's) department.

We have a self join, each copy of the table is given an "alias" - 
-- here we use w for the worker and b for the boss. We can treat these as different tables. 
-- You get an inner join by default - this means that Robin (who has no boss) does not show up in the results.

CREATE TABLE employee(
  employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(10),
  dept_code VARCHAR(10),
  manager_id INTEGER REFERENCES employee);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1,'Robin','Eng',NULL);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (2,'Jon','SoC',1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (3,'Andrew','SoC',2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (4,'Alison','SoC',2);
SELECT w.first_name as worker, b.first_name as boss
 FROM employee w, employee b
WHERE w.manager_id = b.employee_id;

-- Column name with spaces --

-- 6. SELECT a column whose name contains spaces?
-- You can access columns where the name contains a space.

CREATE TABLE SpaceMonster(`Account Balance` INT);
INSERT INTO SpaceMonster VALUES (42);
SELECT `Account Balance` FROM SpaceMonster;

-- NULL --

-- 7. The NULL value may be used to indicate missing or unknown data. You can use the phrase IS NULL to select these values.

SELECT name,gdp
FROM world
WHERE gdp IS NULL;
