--  Question 9
You are working with a database table that contains customer data. The table includes columns about customer location such as city, state, and country. The state names are abbreviated. You want to retrieve the first 2 letters of each state name. You decide to use the SUBSTR function to retrieve the first 2 letters of each state name, and use the AS command to store the result in a new column called new_state. 

You write the SQL query below. Add a statement to your SQL query that will retrieve the first 2 letters of each state name and store the result in a new column as new_state. 

SELECT
customer_id,
SUBSTR(state,1,2) AS new_state
FROM
customer
ORDER BY
state DESC

-- You are working with a database table that contains customer data. The table includes columns about customer location such as city, state, country, and postal_code. You want to check for postal codes that are greater than 7 characters long. 

SELECT 
*
FROM

WHERE
LENGTH(postal_code) > 7;
